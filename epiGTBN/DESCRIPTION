Description: Here is Epi-GTBN, An Approach of Epistasis Mining Based on Genetic Tabu Algorithm and Bayesian Network.
    It uses genetic tabu algorithm into the heuristic search strategy of Bayesian network. 
    The individual structure can be evolved through the genetic manipulations of selection, crossover and mutation. It can help 
    to find the optimal network structure, and then mine the epistasis loci in further. 
    In order to enhance the diversity of the population and obtain a more effective global optimal solution, we implement 
    the tabu search strategy into the operations of crossover and mutation in genetic algorithm.
